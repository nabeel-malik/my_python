    "What’s cool about Pandas is that it takes data (like a CSV or TSV file, or a SQL database) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called data frame that looks very similar to table in a statistical software (think Excel or SPSS for example). This is so much easier to work with in comparison to working with lists and/or dictionaries through for loops or list comprehensions.\n",
