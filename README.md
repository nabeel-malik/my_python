# my_python
my_python is my working personal Python repository.
This repository primarily contains content from Python fundamentals (pybook), practice programs (my_programs), some regular expressions srcipts (regex), some Python course work (corey_schafer and intro_to_python_course) and some file handling scripts (file_handling).
