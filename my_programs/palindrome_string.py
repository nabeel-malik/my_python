USAGE OF math.ceil(x) AND math.floor(x)

Round up, down. Let us consider this program. We use math.ceil to always round up to the nearest integer.
Round() cannot do thisâ€”it will round up or down depending on the fractional value.
Ceil: math.ceil(x)
This will always round up. So the ceil of 1.1 is 2. An integer is returned.
Floor: math.floor(y)
This will round down to the nearest integer. The floor of 1.9 is 1. This is a mathematical function.

user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

tot_comparisons = (math.ceil(len(user_input)/2))

for comparison in range (0, tot_comparisons):
    if user_input[0 + comparison] != user_input[-1 - comparison]:
        print("The entered string is NOT a palindrome!")
        break
else:
    print ("The entered string IS a palindrome!")
